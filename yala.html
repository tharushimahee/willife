      <h2 class="Yala-h2">Leopard Density of Yala National Park</h2>
      <p>Yala National Park, situated in the southeastern corner of Sri Lanka, stands as one of the country's premier wildlife
      sanctuaries, renowned for its rich biodiversity and, in particular, its thriving population of leopards (Panthera pardus
      kotiya). The park spans an extensive area of approximately 979 square kilometers, encompassing a diverse range of
      ecosystems, from dense forests to arid plains. What sets Yala apart is its remarkable leopard density, making it one of
      the best places in the world to observe and study these elusive big cats in their natural habitat.
      
      The leopard population in Yala National Park is a testament to the park's successful conservation efforts and the
      preservation of an ideal habitat for these majestic creatures. The density of leopards in Yala is notably high compared
      to other wildlife reserves, with estimates indicating a concentration of around 20 to 25 individuals per 100 square
      kilometers. This remarkable abundance provides visitors with a unique opportunity to witness the elusive leopards
      engaged in various activities, including hunting, mating, and nurturing their cubs.
      
      The park's landscape plays a pivotal role in sustaining such a high leopard density. Yala encompasses a mosaic of
      ecosystems, ranging from dense monsoon forests to open grasslands and coastal areas. This diversity creates a perfect
      balance, offering leopards an array of environments that cater to their various needs, such as hunting grounds, resting
      spots, and breeding sites. The Wilpattu Complex, within Yala, adds to this diversity, further enhancing the overall
      habitat quality for leopards.
      
      The leopard density in Yala National Park has not only contributed to the ecological balance but has also elevated the
      park to global recognition as a prime destination for wildlife enthusiasts and researchers alike. Conservation
      initiatives, including habitat preservation, anti-poaching measures, and community involvement, have played a crucial
      role in sustaining this remarkable leopard population. As a result, Yala National Park stands as a shining example of
      successful conservation practices, fostering a harmonious coexistence between humans and these magnificent big cats in
      their natural wilderness.
