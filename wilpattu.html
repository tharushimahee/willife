    <p>Wilpattu National Park, situated in the Northwestern part of Sri Lanka, is a sanctuary of immense biodiversity,
    showcasing a rich tapestry of ecosystems that contribute to its unique and vibrant natural heritage. Spread across a
    sprawling landscape of approximately 1,317 square kilometers, Wilpattu stands as the largest national park in the
    country, encompassing a diverse range of habitats, including dense jungles, scrublands, lakes, and natural lakeshores.
    This expansive terrain fosters a remarkable array of flora and fauna, making Wilpattu a haven for biodiversity
    enthusiasts and wildlife researchers alike.
    
    The park is renowned for its impressive mammalian diversity, harboring a population of elusive leopards, Sri Lankan
    elephants, water buffaloes, spotted deer, and sloth bears. These iconic species share the landscape with a myriad of
    other mammals, including the sambar deer, wild boar, and the endemic rusty-spotted cat. The park's avian inhabitants
    contribute to its ecological richness, with over 200 bird species recorded, featuring both resident and migratory birds.
    The serene lakes within Wilpattu attract a multitude of water birds, such as painted storks, ibises, and kingfishers.

    conflict. The unique coastal vegetation and natural lakes add to the biodiversity, supporting diverse plant life and
    providing vital water sources for the resident fauna.
    
    While the biodiversity of Wilpattu National Park is undoubtedly impressive, it also faces challenges, including illegal

    to address these challenges and ensure the long-term sustainability of the park's diverse ecosystems. As a testament to
    its ecological significance, Wilpattu National Park was recognized as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2019, underscoring
